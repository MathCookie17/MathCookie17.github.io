<p>
    I've made several different projects. Several are related to math in some way, but some aren't.
    My specialty back on Scratch was "dodging games", though I haven't made one of those in a "real"
    coding language yet. Like many people with GitHub websites, you never quite know what I'm going to make next!
    If you wish to contact me to discuss these projects, my email is mathcookie17@gmail.com.

<a href="https://mathcookie17.github.io/The-2048-Power-Compendium/" class="page_box" style="background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, #ffff00, #0099ff); border-color: #ffeb87; color: #a08000;">

    <span style="display:inline-block">
    <span class="page_title">The 2048 Power Compendium</span>
    <br>
    A collection of 100 different variants of the classic game 2048, most of which are based on powers of different numbers. A few of these variants come from elsewhere,
    but most of the variants are unique to this collection. In addition to the variants themselves, there are modifiers that can be applied to every variant, such
    as changing the amount of tiles that spawn or adding holes to the grid. There's also a tool that lets you create your own 2048 variants.

    <span style="display:inline-block">
    <span class="page_title">Eternal Notations</span>
    <br>
    A JavaScript library that abbreviates very large numbers into various "notations", such as scientific notation,
    "standard" notation (where 10 million is written as 10 M and 1 billion is written as 1 B), different number bases,
    Roman numerals, and many, many more.
    Clicking this box will take you to a page where you can try out the various (over 100) preset notations included in the library.

    <span class="page_title">Links to my Scratch games</span>
    <br>
    I've made a lot of games on Scratch, and most of my games are much larger and more feature-complete than a typical Scratch project.
    My games include "dodging" games, grid-based multiplayer games, 2048 variants, and more. This page contains links to all of them and a description of each one.

    <span class="page_title">Lartravera</span>
    <br>
    A sort of story I've written, detailing an alternate universe where the laws of physics are different, in such a way that squared versions of all of the
    base units of the metric system (plus dollars and bits) make sense. Contains nine chapters, each of which goes over several topics - I'd say that the whole
    thing is at least the length of a small book. You might want to have some familiarity with physics (a high school level should be sufficient)
    before you start reading this.

<a href="https://mathcookie17.github.io/BlueTile-BGB/" class="page_box" style="background-image: radial-gradient(#7190db 0%, #d0d0ff 85%, #c2b08e 100%); border-color: #465b8d; color: #001f4d;">

    <span style="display:inline-block">
    <span class="page_title">BlueTile: Board Game Builder</span>
    <p>
        A tool that allows users to create their own simple board games, then save them as files to play later.
        Unlike tools like Tabletop Simulator, which simulate the experience of playing a board game in person and leave the enforcement
        of the rules up to the players, BlueTile has game creators use a scripting language to write the rules of the game, and those rules
        will be enforced automatically during gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was made for a Software Design and Development college class as a semester-long group project. I was the one who came up with
        this particular project and was thus the project lead, and I made most of the backend, while one of my groupmates made most of the frontend,
        and my other two groupmates made some smaller contributions.
    </p>
    <p>(Note: Unlike most of my projects, this one only supports desktop/laptop/etc., not mobile)</p>

    <span class="page_title">break_eternity.js</span>
    <p>
        A JavaScript library for storing large numbers, capable of working with numbers up to and including tetrational-sized values, used by many incremental games for which exponentiation isn't big enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        This library was created by Patashu, but he has since mostly moved on from developing it, so the updates it's recieved in the past couple years
        were made by me, most notably the addition of arbitrary-height super-roots. This is the library Eternal Notations uses for storing the numbers it abbreviates.

<a href="Blog Posts/index.html" class="page_box" style="background-image: linear-gradient(#007f92, #008c2c); border-color: #33ba74; color: #8dffab;">
    <span style="display:inline-block">
    <span class="page_title">List of "Blog Posts"</span>
    <br>
    This is where I put things that are moreso "infodumps on stuff I took enough interest in to write about"
    rather than actual projects... do these actually count as blog posts? I'm not sure if
    there's some condition I have to meet for this to be considered a "blog". Either way, there's a couple things here
    that might be interesting to read about.
