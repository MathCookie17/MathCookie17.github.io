    I've made several different projects. Several are related to math in some way, but some aren't.
    My specialty back on Scratch was "dodging games", though I haven't made one of those in a "real"
    coding language yet. Like many people with GitHub websites, you never quite know what I'm going to make next!
    If you wish to contact me to discuss these projects, my email is mathcookie17@gmail.com.

    I've made a lot of games on Scratch, and most of my games are much larger and more feature-complete than a typical Scratch project.
    My games include "dodging" games, grid-based multiplayer games, 2048 variants, and more. This page contains links to all of them and a description of each one.

    <br>
    Polyforge is my favorite mobile game, and possibly my favorite video game as a whole. It has infinite levels that gradually get harder and harder...
    so, after spending a while analyzing how the level-generating algorithm might work, I've created a table of the first 700 levels of Polyforge,
    sorting them based on the types of shapes they are.

    A sort of story I've written, detailing an alternate universe where the laws of physics are different, in such a way that squared versions of all of the
    base units of the metric system (plus dollars and bits) make sense. Contains nine chapters, each of which goes over several topics - I'd say that the whole
    thing is at least the length of a small book. You might want to have some familiarity with physics (a high school level should be sufficient)
    before you start reading this.

    <br>
    A collection of 50 different variants of the classic game 2048, most of which are based on powers of different numbers. A few of these variants come from elsewhere,
    but most of the variants are unique to this collection. In addition to the variants themselves, there are modifiers that can be applied to every variant, such
    as changing the amount of tiles that spawn or adding holes to the grid.

    A JavaScript library that abbreviates very large numbers into various "notations", such as scientific notation,
    "standard" notation (where 10 million is written as 10 M and 1 billion is written as 1 B), different number bases,
    Roman numerals, and many, many more.
    Clicking this box will take you to a page where you can try out the various (over 100) preset notations included in the library.
