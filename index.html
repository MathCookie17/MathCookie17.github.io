I've made a lot of games on Scratch, and most of my games are much larger and more feature-complete than a typical Scratch project.
My games include "dodging" games, grid-based multiplayer games, 2048 variants, and more. This page contains links to all of them and a description of each one.

    <br>
    Polyforge is my favorite mobile game, and possibly my favorite video game as a whole. It has infinite levels that gradually get harder and harder...
    so, after spending a while analyzing how the level-generating algorithm might work, I've created a table of the first 700 levels of Polyforge,
    sorting them based on the types of shapes they are.
