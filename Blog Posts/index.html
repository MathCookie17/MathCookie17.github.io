<h1>MathCookie17's "Blog Posts"</h1>
<p>
    This is where I put things that are moreso "infodumps on stuff I took enough interest in to write about"
    rather than actual projects... do these actually count as blog posts? I'm not sure if
    there's some condition I have to meet for this to be considered a "blog". Ah well, here's what I've got anyway.

    The 2048 Power Compendium uses a sort of miniature programming language defined within it for defining the rules of modes.
    This system is called CalcArrays, and now that some people have taken an interest in using them to make modes themselves,
    this blog post was made to document how they work.

    <br>
    DIVE is a 2048 variant in which two tiles can merge if one is a multiple of the other.
    Every integer greater than 1 can be reached as a tile, and it has a very intricate color scheme
    it uses to display its tiles so that it's easy to tell what tiles can merge. This blog post
    explains in detail how DIVE's color scheme works.

    <br>
    Polyforge is a mobile game that has infinite levels that gradually get harder and harder.
    After spending a while analyzing how the level-generating algorithm might work, I've created a table of the first 700 levels of Polyforge,
    sorting them based on the types of shapes they are.
