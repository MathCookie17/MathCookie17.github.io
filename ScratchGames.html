    <h2>Dodging Games</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">Most of my best Scratch games are "dodging games", where your goal is to avoid getting hit by the obstacles for as long as possible. These games cannot be won: the goal is to survive as long as possible and go for high scores.</p>
    <div class="games_box">
        <a class="game_button" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/303825137/" style="background-color: #00a3ff; border: 5px solid #005bc7; color: #ff0000;">
            <img src="Scratch Games Images/Survive the Circles.png" width="300" height="auto" alt="A square with a bunch of circles around it.">
            <br><span class="game_title">Survive The Circles</span>
            <br>My first dodging game, and a good first game to play for those that haven't played any of my games before. Drag around the square and avoid getting hit by the circles for as long as possible as more and more circles spawn, as you lose the moment a circle hits you! Contains 32 levels and several customizable modifiers (some of which apply to all levels, and some of which are level-specific).
        </a>
        <a class="game_button" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/323961111/" style="background-color: #4abdff; border: 5px solid #ffc700; color: #8500c3;">

            <br><span class="game_title">Survive the Circler's Attacks</span>
            <br>A two-player game inspired by Survive the Circles and those Undertale battle simulator fangames. In this game, one player plays as the "Circler" and spawns the attacks, while the other player plays as the Square and dodges. You can also set up a series of attacks to spawn and dodge them in single-player, making this project act as Survive the Circles's equivalent of the Custom Games of Polystar Dodger and Greyscale Wormhole Operator (though Survive the Circler's Attacks came first).
        </a>
        <a class="game_button" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/358864336/" style="background-color: #000000; border: 5px solid #ff7a00; color: #3f0;">

            <br><span class="game_title">Hole's Orbit</span>
            <br>My second dodging game, inspired by Super Hexagon. You play as a spaceship that's stuck in orbit around a black hole. Cosmic debris is being sucked in by the black hole, and if you're hit by the debris, you'll be pulled in too. Avoid getting hit by the debris! Contains 36 levels and some customizable modifiers, as well as "Hyper Mode" versions of each level which are faster and harder.

            <br><span class="game_title">Laser Shapes Attack!</span>
            <br>My third doging game. This game has 18 levels, each one based on a different shape. The shape you play as controls differently depending on its, well, shape, and the laser shapes fire different patterns of lasers depending on what shape they are. The amount of laser shapes that spawn at a time increases every 30 seconds or so. Avoid getting hit by a laser as long as you can! In each level, the shape you're playing as and the shape of the laser shapes is the same, but there's also a Custom Game that lets you set your shape and the laser shape independently (among other modifiers). There are also Hard Mode versions of each level, where your shape is the same but the laser shapes fire in harder-to-dodge patterns. This game tracks the world record for each of its 18 levels and for the Hard Mode variations of each level.

            <br><span class="game_title">Laser Shapes Attack! Expanded</span>
            <br>A larger version of Laser Shapes Attack! that increases the level count to 34 and approximately triples the amount of Custom Game options... but unlike the original Laser Shapes Attack!, this game does not track its world records.

            <br><span class="game_title">Polystar Dodger</span>
            <br>If you took the Star laser shape from Laser Shapes Attack!, played as Square, and made a full game from it, you'd get this game. Drag around the square to dodge stars which fly across the screen and burst into smaller stars upon hitting the edge, with the amount of mini-stars released from each star getting higher the longer you survive. This game contains 30 levels, and is my first game to contain a full-fledged Custom Game that allows you to mix-and-match every modifier in the game, including every property of every level and some properties that are exclusive to Custom Game, for a total of 90 different properties.

            <br><span class="game_title">Greyscale Wormhole Operator</span>
            <br>My most recent and most complex dodging game. In this game, you change the gravity angle and strength of a black hole-like object to move around a broken spaceship to dodge cosmic debris. This game has 32 levels, some of which are very different from each other. Greyscale Wormhole Operator has a Custom Game that's even more expansive than Polystar Dodger's, with an amount of modifiers that, depending on how you look at it, may exceed two hundred. The Custom Game also has save codes, allowing you to save a previously-created custom game and play it again without having to set it up again.

    <h2>Grid-Based Multiplayer Games</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">These four games are multiplayer games that take place on a square grid, and unlike the dodging games, these do have a winner.</p>

The 2 tiles are white, the -2 tiles are black, the 4 tiles are peach, and the -16 tile is blue.">
            <br><span class="game_title">2048 Chess</span>
            <br>A sort of mixture of 2048 and two-player strategic games like chess and checkers, with one player as positive numbers and the other player as negative numbers. Merge your tiles into larger numbers that move faster, use them to attack the other player's tiles or to upgrade your spawners to spawn higher tiles. This game has two ways to win, and the winner is whichever player accomplishes one of them first: create a 2048 tile, or destroy all of the opponent's spawners and tiles.

            <br><span class="game_title">Claim to the Tiles</span>
            <br>A multiplayer game where each player plays as a colored shape. Players take turns moving around the grid, and when you step onto a tile that is not your color, it becomes your color. The player with the most tiles in their color after a certain amount of turns wins. If you move onto a tile that's already your color, you gain a Charge Point. Charge Points are used to perform Specials: each shape has a different special, most of which color several tiles at once in different ways. Each shape also has a SUPER Special, a version of their Special that costs 8 Charge Points instead of 3 but is approximately thrice as powerful. Contains 45 shapes, three gamemodes, some extra options, and some bonus shapes that are only playable in certain modes or with certain options enabled.

            <br><span class="game_title">Color vs. Chromovores</span>
            <br>A sort of spin-off/sequel to Claim to the Tiles. This time, the players play as drawing utensils, and the movement and Special system has been revamped so movement requires 2 Ink and Specials (now called Special Paints; colors replace shapes here and each color only has one Special Paint, which is more like a SUPER Special than a regular Special) cost 30 Ink, and you can skip your turn to gain 6 Ink; this gives players more mobility and allows them to not have to rely entirely on their Special Paints. This time, the players are up against the Chromovores, creatures that move on their own and eat the color off of tiles, turning them empty again. Color vs Chromovores has a cooperative mode (where all the players are on the same team against the Chromovores) and a competitive mode (where the player with the most tiles in their color wins, but the Chromovores can win if there are more empty tiles than tiles of any single color).

            <br><span class="game_title">Splatter</span>
            <br>Splatter, originally created by the author Ben Orlin in his book "Math Games with Bad Drawings", is a two-player game where players take turns splattering paint blobs, either on their own or with a 3x3 grid around them, with the goal of being the last player with an unsplattered blob remaining. This Scratch game takes the concept and vastly expands it, going from the book's two suggested gamemodes to over 25 gamemodes in the project, including all sorts of new patterns and game mechanics, as well as allowance for more than two players and a Custom Game that lets you create your own gamemodes with every mechanic from every gamemode (and more, such as the ability to create your own patterns) available.

            <br>One of my oldest projects: a puzzle game where you have to change the colors of triangles to match the rectangles above them, but clicking on one triangle changes the color of two.

The tools included allow you to find the two factors of a number that are closest to each other, calculate polygonal numbers, convert words to numbers using various conversion rules, find "smooth" numbers and other factorization-related sequences, calculate tetration (repeated exponentiation) and its two inverses, and perform base conversion for numbers large enough to require power towers or tetration to represent.

            <br><span class="game_title">3125</span>
            <br>A variation of 2048 based on powers of 5 instead of powers of 2: two tiles can merge if they add up to a number that's a power of 5 or double, triple, or quadruple a power of 5, so the valid tiles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and so on. This game is outdated; it's still available by itself here, but if you want to play 3125 now, you should play it in the 2048 Power Compendium instead.

Like in 3125, the rules for which tiles merge in which gamemode do not always require the merging tiles to be the same!
