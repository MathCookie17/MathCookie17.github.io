    <h2>Dodging Games</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">Most of my best Scratch games are "dodging games", where your goal is to avoid getting hit by the obstacles for as long as possible. These games cannot be won: the goal is to survive as long as possible and go for high scores.</p>
    <hr><img src="Survive the Circles.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A square with a bunch of circles around it.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/303825137/" style="font-size:200%;">Survive the Circles</a>
    <br><p>My first dodging game, and a good first game to play for those that haven't played any of my games before. Drag around the square and avoid getting hit by the circles for as long as possible as more and more circles spawn, as you lose the moment a circle hits you! Contains 32 levels and several customizable modifiers (some of which apply to all levels, and some of which are level-specific).</p>
    <br><img src="Survive the Circler's Attacks.png" width="605" height="455" alt="A square with three red circles, three small yellow circles, three big purple circles, and one blue circle with blue and pink concentric circles inside, a black circle at the center, and a yellow outline.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/323961111/" style="font-size:200%;">Survive the Circler's Attacks</a>
    <br><p>A two-player game inspired by Survive the Circles and those Undertale battle simulator fangames. In this game, one player plays as the "Circler" and spawns the attacks, while the other player plays as the Square and dodges. You can also set up a series of attacks to spawn and dodge them in single-player, making this project act as Survive the Circles's equivalent of the Custom Games of Polystar Dodger and Greyscale Wormhole Operator (though Survive the Circler's Attacks came first)</p><hr><img src="Hole's Orbit.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A spaceship orbiting a black hole in space, with two pieces of debris nearby.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/358864336/" style="font-size:200%;">Hole's Orbit</a>
    <br><p>My second dodging game, inspired by Super Hexagon. You play as a spaceship that's stuck in orbit around a black hole. Cosmic debris is being sucked in by the black hole, and if you're hit by the debris, you'll be pulled in too. Avoid getting hit by the debris! Contains 36 levels and some customizable modifiers, as well as "Hyper Mode" versions of each level which are faster and harder.</p>
    <hr><img src="Laser Shapes Attack!.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A blue triangle dodging red lasers on a yellow background, with two grey triangles on the bottom of the screen that are pointing upwards.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/365983122/" style="font-size:200%;">Laser Shapes Attack!</a>
    <br><p>My third doging game. This game has 18 levels, each one based on a different shape. The shape you play as controls differently depending on its, well, shape, and the laser shapes fire different patterns of lasers depending on what shape they are. The amount of laser shapes that spawn at a time increases every 30 seconds or so. Avoid getting hit by a laser as long as you can! In each level, the shape you're playing as and the shape of the laser shapes is the same, but there's also a Custom Game that lets you set your shape and the laser shape independently (among other modifiers). There are also Hard Mode versions of each level, where your shape is the same but the laser shapes fire in harder-to-dodge patterns. This game tracks the world record for each of its 18 levels and for the Hard Mode variations of each level.</p>\
    <br><img src="Laser Shapes Attack! Expanded.png" width="603" height="451" alt="An eight-pointed star on a mahogany background, surrounded by V-shaped laser projectiles that are being fired from larger eight-pointed stars.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/446166266/" style="font-size:200%;">Laser Shapes Attack! Expanded</a>
    <br><p>(<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/448014622/">Without Music</a>)</p>
    <p>A larger version of Laser Shapes Attack! that increases the level count to 34 and approximately triples the amount of Custom Game options... but unlike the original Laser Shapes Attack!, this game does not track its world records.</p>
    <hr><img src="Polystar Dodger.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A light blue square, five small blue five-pointed stars, and one large blue five-pointed star on a yellow and blue radial gradient background (blue in the center) with white dots throughout the background.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/416784291/" style="font-size:200%;">Polystar Dodger</a>
    <br><p>(<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/428213787/">Without Music</a>)</p>
    <p>If you took the Star laser shape from Laser Shapes Attack!, played as Square, and made a full game from it, you'd get this game. Drag around the square to dodge stars which fly across the screen and burst into smaller stars upon hitting the edge, with the amount of mini-stars released from each star getting higher the longer you survive. This game contains 30 levels, and is my first game to contain a full-fledged Custom Game that allows you to mix-and-match every modifier in the game, including every property of every level and some properties that are exclusive to Custom Game, for a total of 90 different properties.</p>
    <hr><img src="Greyscale Wormhole Operator.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A square with cracks in it that's orbiting a grey circle with a magenta outline, and two circular pieces of debris, on a background that's like outer space but more grey.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/490855178/" style="font-size:200%;">Greyscale Wormhole Operator</a>
    <br><p>(<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/546305472/">Save Code Simulator</a>)</p>
    <p>My most recent and most complex dodging game. In this game, you change the gravity angle and strength of a black hole-like object to move around a broken spaceship to dodge cosmic debris. This game has 32 levels, some of which are very different from each other. Greyscale Wormhole Operator has a Custom Game that's even more expansive than Polystar Dodger's, with an amount of modifiers that, depending on how you look at it, may exceed two hundred. The Custom Game also has save codes, allowing you to save a previously-created custom game and play it again without having to set it up again. This game is a hair's breadth away from the Scratch project size limit, so if it's too big for your device to run, the Save Code Simulator is a smaller version that does not contain the Custom Game setup but does contain the base game's levels and still lets you play save codes made in the full version.</p>

    <h2>Grid-Based Multiplayer Games</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">These three games are multiplayer games that take place on a square grid, and unlike the dodging games, these do have a winner.</p>
    <hr><img src="Claim to the Tiles.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A 9x9 grid of white, red, blue, yellow, and green square tiles, with a red circle, a blue square, a yellow triangle, and a green plus-sign cross shape with faces scattered around the grid.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/329230502/" style="font-size:200%;">Claim to the Tiles</a>
    <br><p>A multiplayer game where each player plays as a colored shape. Players take turns moving around the grid, and when you step onto a tile that is not your color, it becomes your color. The player with the most tiles in their color after a certain amount of turns wins. If you move onto a tile that's already your color, you gain a Charge Point. Charge Points are used to perform Specials: each shape has a different special, most of which color several tiles at once in different ways. Each shape also has a SUPER Special, a version of their Special that costs 8 Charge Points instead of 3 but is approximately thrice as powerful. Contains 45 shapes, three gamemodes, some extra options, and some bonus shapes that are only playable in certain modes or with certain options enabled.</p>
    <hr><img src="Color vs Chromovores.png" width="625" height="470" alt="An 11x11 grid of white, pink, yellow, blue, and chartreuse tiles, with several little drawing utensil characters and white circles with teeth on it.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/392235614/" style="font-size:200%;">Color vs Chromovores</a>
    <br><p>A sort of spin-off/sequel to Claim to the Tiles. This time, the players play as drawing utensils, and the movement and Special system has been revamped so movement requires 2 Ink and Specials (now called Special Paints; colors replace shapes here and each color only has one Special Paint, which is more like a SUPER Special than a regular Special) cost 30 Ink, and you can skip your turn to gain 6 Ink; this gives players more mobility and allows them to not have to rely entirely on their Special Paints. This time, the players are up against the Chromovores, creatures that move on their own and eat the color off of tiles, turning them empty again. Color vs Chromovores has a cooperative mode (where all the players are on the same team against the Chromovores) and a competitive mode (where the player with the most tiles in their color wins, but the Chromovores can win if there are more empty tiles than tiles of any single color).</p>
    <hr><img src="Splatter.png" width="603" height="455" alt="An 8x8 grid of white, blue, and yellow tiles. The white tiles have paint blobs on them, some of which are yellow and some of which are blue.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/723289171/" style="font-size:200%;">Splatter</a>
    <br><p>Splatter, originally created by the author Ben Orlin in his book "Math Games with Bad Drawings", is a two-player game where players take turns splattering paint blobs, either on their own or with a 3x3 grid around them, with the goal of being the last player with an unsplattered blob remaining. This Scratch game takes the concept and vastly expands it, going from the book's two suggested gamemodes to over 25 gamemodes in the project, including all sorts of new patterns and game mechanics, as well as allowance for more than two players and a Custom Game that lets you create your own gamemodes with every mechanic from every gamemode (and more, such as the ability to create your own patterns) available.</p>

    <div style="background-color:#ffe600;border:10px solid #fff492;margin:30px;">
    <h2>2048 Variants</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">Games based on the popular game <a href="https://play2048.co/">2048</a>.</p>
    <hr><img src="3125.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A 4x4 square grid. Some tiles are empty and white, others are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, and 25. The 1, 2, 3, and 4 tiles are shades of grey, the 5s and 15 tiles are shades of red, and the 25 tile is light blue">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/284912743/" style="font-size:200%;">3125</a>
    <br><p>A variation of 2048 based on powers of 5 instead of powers of 2: two tiles can merge if they add up to a number that's a power of 5 or double, triple, or quadruple a power of 5, so the valid tiles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and so on. This game is outdated; it's still available, but if you want to play 3125 now...</p>
    <hr><img src="2048 Power Compendium.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A 3x3 square grid of colored tiles, each of which has a 4-digit number on it (except for the bottom-right tile, which has an X on it instead).">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/379989988/" style="font-size:200%;">The 2048 Power Compendium</a>
    <br><p>...then you should play it in this game instead. The original 2048 Power Compendium is a collection of nine 2048 variants. The original 2048 and 3125 are both in this collection, as is 2187 (a powers of 3 variation that also exists elsewhere), but the other six variants are new: variants for powers of 4, 6, 7, and 8, a variant for numbers that are 1 less than a power of 2, and a somewhat custom variation where you get to choose how many of the same tile must line up to merge. Like in 3125, the rules for which tiles merge in which gamemode do not always require the merging tiles to be the same!</p>
    <br><img src="EXTENDED 2048 Power Compendium.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A 4x4 square grid of colored tiles, each of which has a 4-digit number on it (except for the bottom-right tile, which has an X on it instead).">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/390233934/" style="font-size:200%;">The EXTENDED 2048 Power Compendium</a>
    <p>The EXTENDED 2048 Power Compendium goes further, adding another seven new variants: powers of 9, 10, 11, and 12, a factorials variant that combines the variants for powers of 2 through 12, a variant for numbers 1 less than a power of 3, and a variant for numbers 1 more than a power of 2, bringing the total to sixteen variants. This game is too big to run on some smaller devices, which is why the original still exists as a separate project from the extended version.</p>
    <hr><img src="2048 Chess.png" width="625" height="470" alt="An 8x8 square grid. Some tiles are empty and white, others are numbered 2, 4, -2, and -16, and four of them have an S above their number; these S tiles are on opposite ends of the board. The 2 tiles are white, the -2 tiles are black, the 4 tiles are peach, and the -16 tile is blue.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326282705/" style="font-size:200%;">2048 Chess</a>
    <br><p>This game isn't really a 2048 variant: it's a game inspired by 2048, but it's a two-player multiplayer game inspired by games like chess and checkers, with one player as positive numbers and the other player as negative numbers. Merge your tiles into larger numbers that move faster, use them to attack the other player's tiles or to upgrade your spawners to spawn higher tiles. This game has two ways to win, and the winner is whichever player accomplishes one of them first: create a 2048 tile, or destroy all of the opponent's spawners and tiles.</p>

    <h2>Other Projects</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">Not all of my games fit into those three categories, and I've also made a few Scratch projects that aren't technically games, so this section is for the leftovers.</p>
    <hr><img src="Triangle Puzzles 2.0.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A yellow triangle with red, green, and blue triangles on its corners and arrows between these three small triangles. Blue, red, and chartreuse rectangles are off to the side of the small triangles.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/203658170/" style="font-size:200%;">Triangle Puzzles 2.0</a>
    <br><p>(<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/171305224/ ">original version</a>)</p>
    <p>One of my oldest projects: a puzzle game where you have to change the colors of triangles to match the rectangles above them, but clicking on one triangle changes the color of two. The original Triangle Puzzles is the outdated version, as Triangle Puzzles 2.0 introduces some additional features, most notably changing the amount of colors in the puzzle.</p>
    <hr><img src="Viral Eliminator.png" width="625" height="470" alt="A rectangular grid of grey tiles that contains square viruses in red, blue, and yellow. The background is a green and blue checkerboard.">
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/375261811/" style="font-size:200%;">Viral Eliminator</a>
    <br><p>A recreation of the Game Boy Advance game Dr. Mario (in gameplay, at least; Mario himself isn't there) with several customization modifiers that the original game did not have. This game was created as a gift to my grandmother, so that she has a way to continue playing Dr. Mario once her Game Boy Advance dies.</p>
    <hr><img src="Large Number Abbreviator.png" width="625" height="470" alt='A white background with three green boxes with words in them on it. The text "10 TTgTcMc-TTgTcMl-DTgTc" is on the top of the screen.'>
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/342132531/" style="font-size:200%;">MathCookie's Large Number Abbreviator</a>
    <br><p>A tool for converting large numbers into the notations seen in various different incremental games. Contains 30 different notations, several of which have multiple variations known as "dialects". The abbreviator supports numbers up to 10<sup>10<sup>10<sup>308</sup></sup></sup>, though not all of its notations go that high.<p>
    <hr><img src="Tetration Calculator (Niche Math Toolbox).png" width="625" height="470" alt='A light rose magenta background with the word Tetration Calculator on top. Below that is the text "Input: 3^^4", then "Result: 1 PT 3.6383 x 10^12", then buttons that say "Reselect Numbers" and "Return to Toolbox".'>
    <br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/408906805/" style="font-size:200%;">MathCookie's Niche Math Toolbox</a>
    <br><p>This project is a collection of eight math-related tools that probably don't have any real-world use to them, but should be fun to play around with. The tools included allow you to find the two factors of a number that are closest to each other, calculate polygonal numbers, convert words to numbers using various conversion rules, find "smooth" numbers and other factorization-related sequences, calculate tetration (repeated exponentiation) and its two inverses, and perform base conversion for numbers large enough to require power towers or tetration to represent.</p>
